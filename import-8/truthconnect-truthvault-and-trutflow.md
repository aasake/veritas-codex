# TruthConnect + TruthVault + TrutFlow  
*The Technological Architecture of Kingdom Collaboration*

## Introduction

This is not just a tech stack. It is a **temple of communication**, a prophetic infrastructure for storing, sharing, and flowing the truths of the Kingdom. Where Big Tech spies, TruthVault preserves. Where the world manipulates, TruthConnect builds in righteousness.

## System Blueprint

### 1. **TruthConnect**
- Secure, encrypted connection between remnant communities
- Peer-to-peer Gospel fellowship and kingdom project collaboration
- Local-first, cloud-optional, anti-censorship

### 2. **TruthVault**
- Immutable scroll archive
- Prophetic journaling, dream logs, evidence records
- Tied to personal testimony and legal case history

### 3. **TrutFlow**
- Visual interface to track prayers, revelations, deliverables
- UI powered by spirit-led workflows
- Connects with Supabase and GitBook backend

## Data as Testimony

- Not just analytics—**remembrancers of the LORD**
- Every entry is a scroll
- Every action is part of the prophecy

> "Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables..."  
> —Habakkuk 2:2

## Integration Plan

- GitHub for code
- GitBook for scrolls
- Supabase for data
- AI interfaces under the fear of God

## Final Charge

Let data serve truth—not the other way around.  
Let systems build people—not enslave them.  
Let the Vault be holy, the Flow be clean, and the Connect be strong.

**"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits."**  
—Daniel 11:32 (1611 A.V.)
