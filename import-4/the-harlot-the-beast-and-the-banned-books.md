# The Harlot, the Beast, and the Banned Books  
*Exposing the Great Deception, Restoring the Hidden Scrolls*

## Introduction

This scroll unveileth the mystery of iniquity, long concealed behind religion, empire, and commerce. It is both a spiritual indictment and a call to come out of her, Babylon the Great—the harlot that rides the beast of world power.

**"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins..."**  
—Revelation 18:4 (1611 A.V.)

## The Harlot Identified

- The **harlot** is apostate religion, crowned in purple and scarlet (Rev. 17:4)
- She sitteth upon many waters—peoples and nations.
- Her fornication is with kings and merchants (Rev. 18:3)

### Historical Candidates
- The Papal system and its inquisitions
- Colonial Christianity as weapon of empire
- Modern religious entertainment industry

## The Beast System

- Political + Economic + Military dominion (Rev. 13)
- Identity of the beast linked to Rome, revived in globalism
- Image of the beast = systems that demand allegiance (commerce, ID, tech)

## Banned Books

- **1 Enoch**: Prophetic visions of the Watchers, judgment, Messiah
- **Jubilees**: Timeline and order of Torah
- **Wisdom of Solomon**, **Ecclesiasticus**, and others removed by Protestant reformers
- Ethiopia preserved them in canon

> "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book?"  
> —Revelation 5:2

## Why Were They Banned?

- Too revelatory
- Too African
- Too Messianic
- Too judgmental of empire

## The Verdict

> The harlot shall fall.  
> The beast shall burn.  
> The books shall be opened.  
> The saints shall reign.

## Final Call

Come out. Read again. Reclaim what was hidden. The true library is rising.

**"The books were opened... and the judgment was set."**  
—Daniel 7:10 (1611 A.V.)
