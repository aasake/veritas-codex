# Veritas Law Curriculum  
*Divine Justice, Restored Through Righteous Instruction*

## Introduction

This is no man-made law school. This is the School of the Prophets, the Court of the Most High. Veritas Law is founded upon the eternal statutes of the LORD, not the shifting policies of nations. Its aim: to raise up defenders of the poor, repairers of breaches, and sons of thunder who judge righteously.

**"It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law."**  
—Psalm 119:126 (1611 A.V.)
