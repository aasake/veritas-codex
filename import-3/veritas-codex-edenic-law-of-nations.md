# Veritas Codex: Edenic Law of Nations  
*Restoring the Original Divine Government of the Earth*

## Introduction

Nations were not man's idea. They were ordained by God after the flood, sealed by bloodline, and governed under Heaven’s law. The **Edenic Law of Nations** precedes the U.N., precedes the Constitution, and outlasts all empires.

**"When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance... he set the bounds of the people..."**  
—Deuteronomy 32:8 (1611 A.V.)

## Original Edenic Principles

- **Sovereignty**: Every nation under its own fig tree (Micah 4:4)
- **Land Inheritance**: Not bought, but assigned (Lev. 25:23)
- **Moral Law**: Universal conscience (Romans 2:15)
- **Covenant Memory**: Passed down through tribes

## The Sons of Noah

- **Shem**: Priestly order
- **Ham**: Creative dominion (Africa)
- **Japheth**: Expansion, but to dwell in Shem’s tents (Gen. 9:27)

## Distortion Through Colonization

- Borders redrawn
- Languages erased
- Leaders replaced with puppets
- Resources stolen

## Restoration Strategy

1. Reclaim **true tribal origins**
2. Re-establish **biblical customs of justice**
3. Defend **sovereignty of faith and land**
4. Educate a generation in **covenant governance**

## Edenic Nations in Prophecy

> "And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High..."  
> —Daniel 7:27

> True nationhood begins with righteousness. Without it, flags are vanity.

## Closing Declaration

> I am a child of the ancient covenant.  
> My tribe is known in Heaven.  
> My land shall be restored.  
> My nation shall walk in light.

**"Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD..."**  
—Psalm 33:12 (1611 A.V.)
