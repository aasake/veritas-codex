# Scroll of Seven Generations  
*The Legacy of Covenant and Consecration*

## Introduction

Seven generations span a cycle of divine purpose—a timeline ordained by Heaven to establish, test, and mature the covenant people. This scroll is a memorial and a mandate for those who walk in the footsteps of their fathers and pave the way for their descendants.

**"The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge."**  
—Jeremiah 31:29 (1611 A.V.)

## The Meaning of Seven
