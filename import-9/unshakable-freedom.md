# Unshakable Freedom  
*The Liberty of the Sons of God*

## Introduction

This is not freedom from man’s chains alone—but from sin, fear, shame, and the orphan spirit. True freedom begins in the **inner man**, flows through the **renewed mind**, and stands firm on the **eternal Word**. It is not political. It is prophetic.

**"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."**  
—John 8:36 (1611 A.V.)

## Foundations

- Freedom is not doing as thou wilt—it is becoming as He wills.
- Freedom is not escape—it is dominion.
- Freedom is not granted by governments—it is **secured by Christ**.
