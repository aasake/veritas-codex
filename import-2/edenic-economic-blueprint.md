# Edenic Economic Blueprint  
*From Exploitation to Stewardship: God's Original Design*

## Introduction

The world system runs on greed, debt, and exploitation. But the Edenic Blueprint reveals an economy rooted in **stewardship, inheritance, jubilee, and justice**. This scroll lays the foundation for a righteous economy for families, tribes, and nations.

**"The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein."**  
—Psalm 24:1 (1611 A.V.)

## Principles of Edenic Economy

### 1. Land Is Not for Sale
- **"The land shall not be sold for ever..."** (Lev. 25:23)
- Land is a divine inheritance, not a commodity.

### 2. Labor Is Sacred
- Wages must be just (Deut. 24:14–15)
- No man should toil endlessly under Pharaoh

### 3. Jubilee Cycles
- Every 7 years: release of debts
- Every 50 years: restoration of lands and persons (Lev. 25)

### 4. Trade in Righteousness
- No false weights or deceptive pricing
- No exploitation of the poor or foreigner

### 5. Wealth with Purpose
- Storehouses for famine and generosity
- Entrepreneurship that multiplies seed, not vanity

## Modern Restoration Plan

- Cooperative agriculture
- Tribal financial systems
- Digital tools with integrity
- Restorative justice-based lending

## Vocabulary (Webster’s 1828)

- **Usury**: The practice of lending money at excessive or illegal interest.
- **Steward**: One who manages another’s property; not an owner, but a caretaker.

## Prophetic Outlook

> The righteous shall inherit the land  
> The meek shall own the earth  
> The gold of Ophir shall return to Zion

**"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD..."**  
—Proverbs 19:17 (1611 A.V.)
